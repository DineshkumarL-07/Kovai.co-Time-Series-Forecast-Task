This file is about my Insights for this task,

Initially,
1) By understanding the dataset and by forecasting, I can clearly able to see that the,
Forecasting trends may reveal consistent weekly patterns, especially for services like 'Peak Service' and 'School Routes', 
which are likely to show higher patronage on weekdays and lower on weekends.

2) I can observe that more people are using the Light Rail over time, it could mean they prefer it because itâ€™s more reliable or faster. 
On the other hand, if fewer people are using it, it might be because the service isn't good or there are better transport 
options available.

3) The correlation analysis might show that people who use Rapid Routes also often use Local Routes. This could mean that they take a Rapid Route 
for the main part of their trip and a Local Route for getting to or from the station.

4) School Routes may impact overall patronage patterns, especially if school days consistently see a rise in Local Route or Peak Service usage. 
This pattern could suggest that students contribute significantly to total ridership, influencing peak periods on school days.

5) People are showing less interest on the 'Other' transport service, they have alternatives like "Local Route," "Light Rail," "Peak Service," "Rapid Route," and "School" services, 
which may provide better options and quality of service. This is my assumption.
