EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

1) Overview: > The dataset consists of daily patronage numbers for various public transport services.
             > Key columns include Date, Local Route, Light Rail, Peak Service, Rapid Route, School and Others
            
2) Data Cleaning: > There are no duplicate entries in the dataset. However, there is one missing value in the 'Other Services' column on
                    01-07-2019. To handle this missing data, I have set the value to '0' for this field.
                  > There is no need to convert the 'Date' column into a datetime type, as the dataset does not include specific time information.

3) Descriptive Statistics: > Calculating the Measures of Central Tendency and Measures of Dispersion is very important to 
                            understand how the data is spread, which helps in analyzing the distribution of patronage.
                           > It was calculated in the Descriptive Statistics file in this folder. 
                             I have computed it for the overall data as well as on a yearly basis.

4) Trend Analysis: > To visualize trends over time for each service type, I used an line plots with matplotlib
                   > From this visualization I can able to see the seasonal patterns like monthly fluctuations   
                   > Code for this visualization is available in Trend_correlation file
        
5) Correlation Analysis: > To understand the relationships between different service types, I have calculated the correlation matrix and visualize it with a heatmap.
                         > By analyzing this heatmap, I can understand how different service types might influence each other, which is useful for multivariate forecasting and deeper insights into user behavior
